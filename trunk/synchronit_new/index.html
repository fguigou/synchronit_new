							The experience lasted almost one year, costed about € 50-60K and resulted in a 2004 style-like version using RemoteScripting (AJAX was starting to use the undocumented feature of XML-RPC) and set the basis for a future project in Germany.</br></br>
							Those attempts in Germany were also difficult and the company finally closed, except for one single "employee": Alvaro.</br></br>
							Aftere a couple of years, new opportunities arised and this time, things seem to be better.</p>

												Camila began her career in 2012 building enterprise applications as many developers, until she came across Geographic Information Systems, which totally caught her eye. So working with maps led her to realize that she has a flare for user interaction.
												<br />
												In 2014 she started working with agile methodologies at Synchronit. So she was introduced to Scrum and Lean, becoming more adaptable to changing circumstances and also she learnt to see her job as a community where you can share not only professional experiences but also your interests and passions. She’s now part of an offshore team which is really challenging, enriching and fun.
												<br />
												After getting her software engineer degree in 2015 Camila moved to Washington D.C. She’s still working with these amazing people from the distance and learning new and challenging things every day.
												<br />
												One of her passions is living a healthy lifestyle, eating clean and training hard keeps her motivated and makes her feel more effective.

                            After getting his Software Engineering diploma at the "Universidad de la República" (UDELAR) of Uruguay, Federico worked in a variety of projects for different companies. Among others, he has experience with bank systems, management systems for state-owned companies, and credit card management systems. Thanks to some of those projects, he had the chance to travel and work in countries such as Mexico, Spain and Germany.</br></br>
							This diversity of projects is the consequence of his constant search for “his place” in the computer world which has led him to work with a lot of interesting people and with different languages and technologies.</br></br>
							The mentioned search did not end, and will probably never end, because he enjoys changing environments and facing new and different challenges.</br></br>
							Federico is also a passionate reader and has found in running something much greater than just a sport, which, apart from being a healthy exercise, gave him the opportunity to meet different people and places, and to live unforgettable experiences. </p>

												While conducting her studies, at early stages of her career, she began to develop for a Uruguayan software company, serving daily thousands of users in over twenty countries. There, she managed to earn experience, learn new technologies and contribute with her own ideas to improve and maintain the product.

												After two years, she decided to take a year off to travel around the world, visiting more than thirty countries. Which, consisted of an extremely enriching personal experience. When she returned to her native country, she joined Synchronit seeking to strengthen her capacities as a developer and dealing with challenging problems. Shortly after, she obtained her Software Engineer degree, as well as a Scrum Master certificate.

						I finished “ Analyst in IT” at ORT Uruguay, while starting “System Engineer” studies at the same university. Meanwhile, I made a project with a partner which involved Computer Vision and after that I realized how little we know about all that exist in the world and I started to study Machine Learning & Computer Vision in order to create programs which goes the extra mile.</br></br>

                            After moving alone to another city at the age of 17, which was an enriching experience, Martin started his studies in SW Engineering at the "Universidad de la República" (UDELAR) of Uruguay.</br></br>
							He started his career in Genexus Consulting as a SQA, and despite having a great year there, he realized that Quality Assurance was not what he really wanted to do and that he needed a change of scenery.</br></br>
							Now, less than a year away of getting his diploma, he joined a group of extraordinary people developing Software and he thinks to have found what he was looking for.

						      <p>The first pre-requisite for a successful project, is to build up a team. And this is not a one-time process. It is a permanent activity.</p>
						      <p>When we are talking about applied-intelligence, we need to consider each human being as a whole. Creativity can only be released to its full-potential, once the whole person can focus on the right issues. </p>
						      <p>People build teams in order to overcome individual limitations (as Peter Drucker used to say) therefore it is important to constantly learn, collaborate, increase common knowledge and achieve an identification with team goals that makes possible to overcome individual egos</p>
					      </div>
					      <div id="freedom" class="value_description value_text_block" style="display: block;">
							<p>After more than 200 years of the French revolution that influenced so many democracies, the fundamental values that inspired it are still to be reaffirmed every day. Universal opportunity is a concept and a practice that we adhere to.</p>
							<p>At Synchronit, we have no managers or hierarchical positions in the traditional sense.</p>
							<p>We believe, each fellow to be a complete professional and entrepreneur and we help as a team, in this personal and professional quest of continuous growth.</p>
							<p>The reason is simple and (why not?) also selfish: the better each member is, the better it is for all. We learned that since living in caves and it is part of what makes us humans.</p>
					      </div>
					      <div id="value_creation" class="value_description value_text_block" style="display: block;">
							<p>We believe, that sharing your work with others for the creation of value means that you benefit from their work, as well as they benefit from yours.</p>
							<p>We believe, that sharing this value is not a mathematical equation and that "the whole is more than the sum of the parts".</p>
							<p>We believe, that proper value creation should enable a relaxed life for all members, whilst ensuring company's existence.</p>
							<p>We believe, that together with our customers the creation of value is such, that win-win situations are a natural consequence of sharing a bright future.</p>
							<p>We believe, that accounting permits an objective measurment of value creation</p>
					      </div>
					      <div id="transparency" class="value_description value_text_block" style="display: block;">
							<p>Transparency is one of the best solutions against corruption.</p>
							<p>And we do not mean just political or economic. We believe in value creation and fair compensation.</p>
							<p>This is not a romantic or utopic position. It helps and forces us to focus in the creation of real value at every single moment and not just to serve tribute to past glories.</p>
							<p>In practice, this means that at Synchronit there is no profit-taken nor dividends. Each person earns purely based on the contribution done to generate value.
							Modern companies are starting to think in this way, like Amazon for example.</p>
