			      <p>When we are talking about applied-intelligence, we need to consider each human being as a whole. Creativity can only be released to its full-potential, once the whole person can focus on the right issues. </p>
			      <p>People build teams in order to overcome individual limitations (as Peter Drucker used to say) therefore it is important to constantly learn, collaborate, increase common knowledge and achieve an identification with team goals that makes possible to overcome individual egos</p>

				<h3>Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité</h3>

				<p>After more than 200 years of the French revolution that influenced so many democracies, the fundamental values that inspired it are still to be reaffirmed every day. Universal opportunity is a concept and a practice that we adhere to.</p>
				<p>At Synchronit, we have no managers or hierarchical positions in the traditional sense.</p>
				<p>We believe, each fellow to be a complete professional and entrepreneur and we help as a team, in this personal and professional quest of continuous growth.</p>
				<p>The reason is simple and (why not?) also selfish: the better each member is, the better it is for all. We learned that since living in caves and it is part of what makes us humans.</p>

				<h3>Value Creation</h3>

				<p>We believe, that sharing your work with others for the creation of value means that you benefit from their work, as well as they benefit from yours.</p>
				<p>We believe, that sharing this value is not a mathematical equation and that "the whole is more than the sum of the parts".</p>
				<p>We believe, that proper value creation should enable a relaxed life for all members, whilst ensuring company's existence.</p>
				<p>We believe, that together with our customers the creation of value is such, that win-win situations are a natural consequence of sharing a bright future.</p>
				<p>We believe, that accounting permits an objective measurment of value creation</p>

				<h3>Transparency</h3>

				<p>Transparency is one of the best solutions against corruption.</p>
				<p>And we do not mean just political or economic. We believe in value creation and fair compensation.</p>
				<p>This is not a romantic or utopic position. It helps and forces us to focus in the creation of real value at every single moment and not just to serve tribute to past glories.</p>
				<p>In practice, this means that at Synchronit there is no profit-taken nor dividends. Each person earns purely based on the contribution done to generate value.
				Modern companies are starting to think in this way, like Amazon for example.</p>

												<strong>" Life is sailing … windsurf shows how to flow with it."</strong>
												After finishing a SW Engineering diploma at the "Universidad de la República" (UDELAR) of Uruguay, performing other studies in the University of Helsinski and working in some other SW companies, Alvaro joined a crazy group of entrepreneurs trying to produce a web-based Open Office, the so-called "OWO" (Open Web Office) in the year 2004.</br></br>
												The experience lasted almost one year, costed about € 50-60K and resulted in a 2004 style-like version using RemoteScripting (AJAX was starting to use the undocumented feature of XML-RPC) and set the basis for a future project in Germany.</br></br>
												Those attempts in Germany were also difficult and the company finally closed, except for one single "employee": Alvaro.</br></br>
												Aftere a couple of years, new opportunities arised and this time, things seem to be better.

						In the previous years I had the luck to work with a lot of different talented people in different parts of the world (USA, ASIA, Europe, Latin America, etc), this invaluable experience helped me to adquire a set of skills, from dealing with technical issues like coding, networking, and team/technical management to more natural areas like the development of interpersonal, negotiation, and mediation skills.</br></br>
						Today, I'm lucky to face the same situation once more, working as an associated consultant for a firm in Switzerland, surrounded with a lot of amazing people, in this never-ending dance of learning, teaching and the most important thing, enjoying the ride as much as possible.

							Federico is also a passionate reader and has found in running something much greater than just a sport, which, apart from being a healthy exercise, gave him the opportunity to meet different people and places, and to live unforgettable experiences.

												<strong> "Life is problems. Living is solving problems."</strong></br>
												A great passion for technology and the desire to understand and participate actively in the application of the latest trends to solve real life problems, made up Lucia's mind to study Software Engineering.
												<br />
												While conducting her studies, at early stages of her career, she began to develop for a Uruguayan software company, serving daily thousands of users in over twenty countries. There, she managed to earn experience, learn new technologies and contribute with her own ideas to improve and maintain the product.
												<br />
												After two years, she decided to take a year off to travel around the world, visiting more than thirty countries. Which, consisted of an extremely enriching personal experience. When she returned to her native country, she joined Synchronit seeking to strengthen her capacities as a developer and dealing with challenging problems. Shortly after, she obtained her Software Engineer degree, as well as a Scrum Master certificate.

												<strong>Life is like a aurora borealis … It’s extremely short and extremely beautiful.</strong></br></br>
						Since the beginning I always loved to solve problems creating systems, learning, etc. Always trying to create something to make things easier or better. On high school I finally I had Internet 24x7 :) and then I started to learn about hardware and PC repair and since then I continued with programming from where I continue to explore and discover new things with every line I put in a code.</br></br>
						I finished “ Analyst in IT” at ORT Uruguay, while starting “System Engineer” studies at the same university. Meanwhile, I made a project with a partner which involved Computer Vision and after that I realized how little we know about all that exist in the world and I started to study Machine Learning & Computer Vision in order to create programs which goes the extra mile.</br></br>
						On the professional line I was always involved with web development creating usable web applications, with the objective of building better experiences and functionalities that actually help the users to have success.
